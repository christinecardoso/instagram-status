## Instagram Status Viewer

Simple Python3 script to collect your Instagram account's followers/followings in Flask. You can now unfollow users right from this panel.

Set your username and password in **main.py** file and run it.

### Requirements

You only need to have Flask installed.

`pip3 install Flask`

`pip3 install requests requests-toolbelt`

`python3 main.py`

Then go to http://localhost:5000 to see the result

### ToDo

- Unfollow should be applied in-place (With JQuery maybe)
